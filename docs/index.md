### 6 December 2022

Photobooth v4.3.1 released!

Build dependencies have been updated and the process of taking an image was improved to optimize the timings between the single actions.
The visible countdown now is independent of the time we need to take an image, the defined offset will be respected now.
Also we now don't wait for the cheese message to end, the picture will be taken without waiting for it.
A small bug was fixed, where the shutter animation was started twice if an cheese image is used.

Like always: The full Changelog can be found [here](changelog.md).


Enjoy Photobooth v4.3.1!
