# Sounds

If you have speakers connected to your Photobooth, you can enable the sound
functionality in the settings.

There are multiple switches you can toggle to enable or disable sounds for
specific actions.

These actions will play sounds if enabled:

-   Countdown: For every second a sound file is played (file format: `counter-$i.mp3`)

The sounds are grouped by `voice` and `language`.

Possible `voice` values are:

-   woman: sounds with a female voice
-   man: sounds with a male voice
-   custom: sounds in your `/private/sounds` directory
