# Photobooth v4

A Photobooth web interface for Linux and Windows.

Photobooth was initially developped by Andre Rinas to use on a Raspberry Pi, you can find his source [here](https://github.com/andreknieriem/photobooth).  
In 2019 Andreas Blaesius picked up the work and continued to work on the source.  
With the help of the community Photobooth grew to a powerfull Photobooth software with a lot of features and possibilities.

### :mag: Changelog

Please take a look at the changelog available on [https://photoboothproject.github.io](https://photoboothproject.github.io).

### :warning: Security advice

Photobooth is not hardened against any kind of *targeted* attacks.
It uses user defined commands for tasks like taking photos and is allowed to replace its own files for easy updating.
Because of this it's not advised to operate Photobooth in an untrusted network and 
**you should absolutely not make Photobooth accessible through the internet without heavy modifications!**

### :copyright: License

Photobooth source is licensed under the MIT license.  
  
Once build, Photobooth incorporates several parts and optimizations that are covered by a different license which could apply to Photobooth as well.  
All dependencies include their respective LICENSE files.

### :tada: Donation

If you like our work and consider a donation, we have to tell you that we don't accept any money. We're happy about every contribution to this project and strive to make it better every day. Just get in touch with us on [Telegram](https://t.me/PhotoboothGroup) to say thank you or help us find ways to improve.

If you still want to donate money to make us happy: consider a donation to an organization that cares about (kids having) cancer. Our lead developer Andreas had blood cancer in 2001 (when he was 12 years old) and he's happy to be still alive.

One good choice of an organisation to donate to would be the [DKMS](https://www.dkms.de) (they also accept donations via [paypal](https://webforms.dkms.de/en/DE/moneydonation/paypal)), but any similar organisation would be fine, too.

Thanks for reading!
