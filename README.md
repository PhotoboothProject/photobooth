![](resources/img/logo/banner.png)

A Photobooth web interface for Linux and Windows.

Photobooth was initially developped by Andre Rinas to use on a Raspberry Pi, you can find his source [here](https://github.com/andreknieriem/photobooth).
In 2019 Andreas Blaesius picked up the work and continued to work on the source.
With the help of the community Photobooth grew to a powerfull Photobooth software with a lot of features and possibilities.

| Hardware-Platform      | Software-Platform                               | Supported Cameras                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Raspberry Pi 3 / 4 / 5 | Raspberry Pi OS 64bit Bullseye / Bookworm       | [Camera Modules](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/camera.html), [gphoto2 DSLR](http://www.gphoto.org/proj/libgphoto2/support.php), webcam _\*2_ |
| Raspberry Pi 3 / 4 / 5 | Raspberry Pi OS 32bit Bullseye / Bookworm _\*1_ | [Camera Modules](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/camera.html), [gphoto2 DSLR](http://www.gphoto.org/proj/libgphoto2/support.php), webcam _\*2_ |
| Generic PC             | Debian/Ubuntu                                   | [gphoto2 DSLR](http://www.gphoto.org/proj/libgphoto2/support.php), webcam _\*2_                                                                                      |
| Generic PC             | Windows                                         | [digiCamControl](http://digicamcontrol.com/), wsl + Debian/Ubuntu subsystem, webcam _\*2_                                                                            |

_\*1 On Raspberry Pi OS 32bit Bullseye you **must** add `arm_64bit=0` to your `/boot/config.txt` and reboot once before installing Photobooth._
_The Raspberry Pi foundation uses a 64bit kernel while the system is 32bit. The Installation fails because the v4l2loopback module can't be compiled for a 32bit OS while using a 64bit kernel._

_\*2 Capture from webcam is possible e.g. using [fswebcam](https://www.sanslogic.co.uk/fswebcam/), else it only works on access via [http://localhost](http://localhost)_
