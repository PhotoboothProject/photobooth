# Security Policy

## Security advice
Photobooth is not hardened against any kind of targeted attacks.
It uses user defined commands for tasks like taking photos and is allowed to replace its own files for easy updating.

Because of this it's not advised to operate Photobooth in an untrusted network and **you should absolutely not make Photobooth accessible through the internet without heavy modifications!**
